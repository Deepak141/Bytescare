Open the Classification.ipny in google colab only
Run all the lines of code one after the other 
model.jason contains the model that i have used
test_weights.h5 contains the trained(trained for person or not by me , you cant get the test_weights.h5 in anywhere)model weights 
If you want to add your own images add it to test folder using colab
Result will be shown wether person is present or not along with the image
if you want to check the result of the single image provide the image path in the path variable present in the code
Thank You
